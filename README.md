# JS30 Mouse Move Shadow
Exercise 16 in WesBos' JavaScript30 tutorials. 

This reminded me of the panel slider exorcise. Only this time instead of CSS doing the magic, it was JS functions creating variables that we could then pass to our CSS. 

I would imagine the main concept of this lesson (offsetX/offsetY) being used to obtain the mouse position can be used for all kinds of applications from performing an action when a users mouse hits a certain element, to knowing if the mouse is off the page or element. 

I updated the code to produce random colors on mousemove and stop on the last random color when the mouse stops.
